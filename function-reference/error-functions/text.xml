<p>
The following functions are provided by the package manager for error handling.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Details</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>die</c></ti>
    <ti>
      <p>
      Displays an error message provided in its argument, and aborts the build
      process.
      </p>
      <p>
      In EAPI 6 and later, <c>die</c> can be called under the <c>nonfatal</c>
      command and with the <c>-n</c> option, in which case it will not abort
      the build process, but return with non-zero status.
      </p>
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>assert</c></ti>
    <ti>
      Checks the value of the <c>PIPESTATUS</c> array, and calls <c>die</c>
      if any of its component is non-zero (which indicates failure of the
      preceding command pipeline).
    </ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>nonfatal</c></ti>
    <ti>
      Takes another command as its argument and executes it. If the command
      fails and would normally die, it returns with non-zero status instead
      when called under <c>nonfatal</c>.
    </ti>
