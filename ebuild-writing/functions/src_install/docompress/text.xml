<title>Controllable compression</title>
<body>

<p>
You can call the <c>docompress</c> function in <c>src_install</c> to control
which items in the destination folder <c>${D}</c> should be compressed and
which shouldn't be compressed. You can include or exclude directories or plain
files. The default inclusion list contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><c>/usr/share/doc</c></li>
  <li><c>/usr/share/info</c></li>
  <li><c>/usr/share/man</c></li>
</ul>

<p>
The default exclusion list contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><c>/usr/share/doc/${PF}/html</c></li>
</ul>

<p>
When a directory is in- or excluded, all files and directories in the given
directories shall be added to the corresponding list. If a file is in- or
excluded, the file shall be added to the corresponding list (exclusion is
stronger than inclusion <d/> if a file is in both lists, the inclusion will
be ignored).
</p>

<p>
If the first argument of <c>docompress</c> is <c>-x</c>, the items specified
will be added to the exclusion list, otherwise they will be added to the
inclusion list.
</p>

<note>
When <c>docompress</c> is called, it is <e>not</e> required that the paths
specified as its arguments are pointing to existing files or directories.
However, if a file still doesn't exist when <c>src_install</c> has completed,
it will be ignored with a warning.
