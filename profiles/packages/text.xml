<title>Profiles <c>packages</c> file</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>packages</c> file in <c>profiles/</c> controls the packages pulled in by the
<c>@system</c> set. The <c>base/packages</c> file must not be modified without
discussion on the <c>gentoo-dev</c> list; subprofile overrides are up to the
relevant arch teams.
</p>

<p>
Note that <c>packages</c> can be used to require that specific versions of a package
be used, for example <c>&lt;sys-kernel/linux-headers-2.5</c> in a profile requiring
a 2.4 kernel. If this is done with the intention of requiring <b>only</b> a lower version
(that is to say, not a &gt; or &gt;= restriction, and with slots not affecting the
outcome), then the entry in <c>packages</c> must be accompanied by a corresponding
<c>package.mask</c> entry to ensure that no other versions get installed.
