<title>Arch specific notes</title>
<body>

<p>
This section provides a brief overview of various arch-specific issues. It is not
complete, and it is not a substitute for discussing any problems with the
relevant arch team.
</p>

<note>
People who have worked with some other distributions may find Gentoo's
views on architecture support slightly unfamiliar. We do not follow Debian's
attempts to provide a standard set of packages at specific versions and install
it onto every platform <d/> rather, we simply attempt to provide whatever
happens to work best in any situation.
