<p>
Gentoo News Items were created to provide a communication medium to push
critical messages to users via the rsync tree. The original proposal for news
items is outlined in <uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0042.html">
GLEP 42: Critical News Reporting.</uri>
</p>

<p>
News Items can be read using the eselect command. More information on use
of this tool to read or delete news items can be found on the news.eselect
man page.

<title>Adding a news item</title>
<body>

<ul>
  <li>
    Choose a filename in the proper format:
    <c>YYYY-MM-DD-shortname.lang.txt</c>, i.e. the date, followed by a very
    short name of at most 20 characters and consisting only of <c>a-z</c>,
    <c>0-9</c>, <c>+</c> (plus), <c>-</c> (hyphen) and <c>_</c> (underscore).
    This is followed by <c>lang</c> which is an
    <uri link="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">IETF language
    tag</uri>. Always use <c>en</c> for English, unless you are translating
    a news item. Finally, the filename ends with the extension <c>txt</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write the news item, which is similar to a RFC-compliant email. Details
    concerning what is allowed can be found in the appropriate GLEP section.
    As a note: Exceptions depending on installed packages or activated
    profiles are possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send the news item to the gentoo-dev mailing list and the Gentoo PR team
    (pr@gentoo.org) 72 hours in advance of commit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wait for corrections or feedback that your news item is not of great
    importance and should be revoked (can be possible).
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a directory structure for your item in the gentoo-news repository
    (<c>git+ssh://git@git.gentoo.org/data/gentoo-news.git</c>):
    <c>YYYY-MM-DD-shortname/</c>.
  </li>
  <li>Add the news file to that directory.</li>
  <li>Commit and push your changes to the gentoo-news repository.</li>
</ul>
