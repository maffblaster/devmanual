<p>
  Changes made to the tree are propagated to the users in stages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Developer commits to local Git clone and pushes to central remote
    Git repository. Commits and pushes are signed using Git
    mechanisms based on GPG.
  </li>
  <li>
    Staging box syncs from central Git repository, generates the metadata cache, ChangeLogs and signed Manifests from Git history.
  </li>
  <li>
    <c>rsync1</c> syncs from the staging box.
  </li>
  <li>
    Public rsync servers sync from <c>rsync1</c>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users sync from the public rsync servers.
  </li>
</ul>
